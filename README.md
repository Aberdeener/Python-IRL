# Python-IRL
In an effort to learn the basics of python, I asked my friends what they wish they could automate on their computer

## netflix.py
Requested to ope Netflix on login (assuming Windows enviroment)
1. Download netflix.py to Desktop.
2. Use windows' task scheduler to schedule script (C:\Users\{NAME}\Desktop\netflix.py) on login (afaik no way in python to load script on boot without 3rd party).
